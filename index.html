  <h2>Apologies: Why & How</h2>
  <h3><i>Making an apology can be difficult, but it shouldn't be a burden. Today, Eraxosthenes and Phrastus talk about some of the toughest aspects.</i></h3>
  <h4>*This is a transcipt from the PoP Philo episode that aired live on 1/24/21*</h4>

  <p>E: Phrastus, thanks so much for having me on the show. <br>
     P: Absolutely, man—thanks for making the trek out. How's LA? <br>
     E: Always moving man, I'm actually glad to get away. The weather is a lot more palatteable, too, haha. <br>
     P: That's great, dude. Care to do the honors, let us know where the money's coming from today? <br>
     E: Oh absolutely. Check it out y'all, today's sponsor is llamas.

     Reaching new heights in internet popularity over the past few months, llamas have won the hearts and wallets of millions...and were kind enough to cover our overhead this week.
     If you haven't yet, make sure to donate to your nearest llama habitat. <br>
     P: Awesome. Now, let's get back to the show. Eraxosthenes, I have a confession.<br>
     E: Oh yeah? What's good? <br>
     P: Well, the other day I think I hurt a good friend's feelings—my main man back in LA, Hestor. <br>
     E: It happens, man—what went down? <br>
     P: Well, he'd been gunning for this promotion at our mutual workplace (Llamacorp), a manager position with really good pay and benefits. ... 
     The problem was, I knew I would get the promotion already but didn't have the heart to tell him...so he went through all the applications
     and lost a lot of sleep trying to do an A+ job...and now he knows I knew I was gonna get the job all along, and is upset I let him
     waste so much time...it's really broken up our friendship, honestly. <br>
     E: Hooo...that sounds really tough, thanks for sharing that. I'm impressed you could air all that out, especially on the show. <br>
     P: Thanks man. And here's the thing, I know I need to apologize--<br>
     E: But apologizing can often feel like <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/W3BUNKgdk4gpky1Egf" width="67" height="120" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-3"></iframe> am I right?<br>
     
     <br>
     <br>
     P: Haha, no kidding. Do you think you could help me out?<br>
     E: Of course. First off, I would definitely check out some of the great stuff <a href = "https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2019/12/18/how-to-give-a-good-apology-part-1-the-four-parts-of-accountability/" target="_blank">Mia Mingus</a>
     has written on the topic. Her two articles there are a great place to start, but there are a few things I can summarize for you on the show. You'll find a very similar list 
     on her blog:
     <ul>
         <li>Literally say "I'm sorry," or "I apologize."</li>
         <li>Acknowledge the harm you dealt as well as the impact it may have had.</li>
         <li>In your acknowledgement of harm, name what you actually did 
             (In your case, you might say,
             "I'm sorry for letting you work for the promotion when I already knew I would get the management position").</li>
         <li>Lastly, commit to changing your behavior, and follow through with this promise.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>
     P: It's nice to have all those aspects laid out so clearly—I usually just try to wing it, but in retrospect I've made a lot of
     rough apologies, haha. <br>
     E: We all have, it's a part of life! Want to take a shot at making an apology? <br>
     <small>*Note from the author: this is getting pretty meta; feel free to apologize for Phrastus (which could be good empathy
     practice), or apologize for something more relavent in your life! --Ben*</small><br>
     P: <button type="button" class="apologyPrac" onclick="apologyFunc()">Oh yeah!<span class="buttontext" id="myPopup"></span></button><br>
     E: Nicely done. Just remember, practice makes perfect. And folks, that's all the time we have tonight—come back next
     week for more coffee and discourse. Peace :D
